# End-to-end Customer Segmentation Project

## About

This project is the demo of the article [BentoML: Create an ML Powered Prediction Service in Minutes](https://towardsdatascience.com/bentoml-create-an-ml-powered-prediction-service-in-minutes-23d135d6ca76?gi=4dfb07bbfa7b).

## Project Structure

- `src`: consists of Python scripts
- `config`: consists of configuration files
- `data`: consists of data
- `processors`: consists of all scikit-learn's transformers used to process the new input

## Set Up the Project

1. Clone this branch:

```bash
git clone --branch bentoml_demo https://github.com/SiddharthUchil/customer_segmentation.git
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Pull data

```bash
dvc pull
```

## Run the Project

To run all flows, type:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Serve Machine Learning Models with BentoML

To serve the trained model, run:

```bash
bentoml serve src/bentoml_app.py:service --reload
```

Now you should be able to interact with the API by going to http://127.0.0.1:5000 and clicking the "Try it out" button:

To send requests to the newly started service in Python, run:

```bash
python src/predict.py
```

Details of `predict.py`:

```python
import requests

prediction = requests.post(
    "http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict",
    headers={"content-type": "application/json"},
    data='{"Income": 58138, "Recency": 58, "Complain": 0,"age": 64,"total_purchases": 25,"enrollment_years": 10,"family_size": 1}',
).text

print(prediction)
```

Output:

```bash
1
```

## Run a Streamlit app

To open a Streamlit app, run:

```bash
streamlit run src/streamlit_app.py
```

then go to http://localhost:8501. You should see a web app like below:
